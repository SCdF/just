# Tradeoffs

## Pros

#### 1. Size
Every Just utility is tiny. They all come in at well under 1K gzipped[¹](#¹Data) and compare very favorably to Lodash modular equivalents

† `instance of` on instances of instructor
* falsey argument discrepancy
π expects number arg (doesn't support coercion) 
¬ doesn't work as expected with other lodash utils
å doesn't work with arguments in lieu of arrays
∞ NaN not equal
∫ non-unique results

* Load speed
* Dependency management
* truly modular
* Less Battle Tested
* Edge cases
* Perf with large collections
* Randomness
* LoDash meant to compete with ES methods for perf
