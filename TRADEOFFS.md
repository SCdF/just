# Tradeoffs

## Pros

#### 1. Size
Every Just utility is tiny. They all come in at well under 1K gzipped[¹](#¹Data) and compare very favorably to Lodash modular equivalents

† `instance of` on instances of partial  
* falsey argument discrepancy  
π expects number arg (doesn't support coercion)   
¬ doesn't work as expected with other lodash utils  
å doesn't work with arguments in lieu of arrays  
∞ NaN not equal  
∫ non-unique results
• zip([[],[]]) => [[[]], [[]]] (as per http://osteele.com/sources/javascript/functional/)
µ should work without lower bound arg
ƒ if outer bounds are NaN should coerce to 0
∞ follows dotty re. get(obj, ['a.b'])

* Load speed
* Dependency management
* truly modular
* Less Battle Tested
* Edge cases
* Perf with large collections
* Randomness
* LoDash meant to compete with ES methods for perf
