# Tradeoffs

## Pros

#### 1. Size
Every Just utility is tiny. They all come in at well under 1K gzipped[¹](#¹Data) and compare very favorably to Lodash modular equivalents

* Less Battle Tested
* Edge cases
* Perf with large collections
* Randomness
* LoDash meant to compete with ES methods for perf
